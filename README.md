# BamBoard
[AR application](https://devpost.com/software/bamboard) created for Menlohacks III.

# Inspiration
Seeing community murals around cities and neighborhoods inspired us to create this same sense of sentiment and community within the internet.

# What it does
Allow people to create and edit/add to digital drawings/art pieces through an easy to use interface that will allow people from all the same or all walks of life to express their feeling and share their story with the addition of their own edits to other people's art. This allows people that may have never known each other come together to collaborate on something they both share.

# How we built it
We built it using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS.

# Challenges we ran into
Uploading and storing files in our database caused us the most trouble since implementing the database would involve restarting the whole project. To get around this, we accessed the files locally.

# What's next for BamBoard
We hope to expand this website to something much larger to allow for everyone around the world to contribute their art and ideas on this platform. We would also like to look into more efficient waves of detecting changes (like detecting strokes/new pixels) as well as a more sophisticated GUI.
